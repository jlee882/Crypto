## Shift_cipher
Classical cryptosystem. 
To run, `python3 ./shift_cipher <enc/dec> <text> <shift>`  
- `enc` to encode a plaintext to ciphertext and `dec` to decode ciphertext to
plaintext
- `<text>` is the text to encode or decode
- `<shift>` is a positive number to shift text by. For encoding, right shift is
performed and decoding, left shift is applied.
